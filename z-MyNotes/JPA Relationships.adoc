== Spring Annotations

#@Component :# +








== JPA :

=== Mixed Annotations

#@Entity :# +

When you put `@Entity` on a class:

* Hibernate/Spring Data JPA will map it to a database table.

* Each field becomes a column (unless you mark it @Transient).

* It makes the class persistent (you can save, update, delete it in the DB).




#@Id :#

* marks this field as the primary key.

#@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) :#

* lets JPA automatically choose the best way to generate unique IDs based on the database when a new record is
     inserted.

=== JPA Many-to-Many Mapping

*Primary Key (PK):*
A unique identifier for each entity (@Id + usually auto-generated).

*Foreign Key (FK):*
A column in the join table pointing to the PK of the related entity.

.Owner side (e.g., Book):
- Annotate with `@ManyToMany` + `@JoinTable(...)`.
- Defines join table name and FK column names.
- JPA writes rows to this table when you persist/update.

.Inverse side (e.g., Author):
- Annotate with `@ManyToMany(mappedBy="authors")`.
- No `@JoinTable` here—JPA just reads the mapping defined on the owner.
- Changes to this side alone do NOT affect the join table.

.Column names:
- Strings in `@JoinColumn(name="author_id")` refer to DB columns.
- JPA maps those to the entity’s PK field (e.g., `Author.id`).

*Best practices:*
- Use `Set<…>` to avoid duplicates.
- Keep both sides in sync in code (add to both collections).
- Only one side owns the mapping to prevent schema conflicts.



 JPA Many-to-Many Quick Reference

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Concept  | Explanation

| Primary Key (PK)
| Unique identifier on each table.
In JPA: `@Id`, usually on a `Long id` field.

| Foreign Key (FK)
| A column in one table referencing another table’s PK. (e.g book_id is FK to PK id from book table)
In JPA you get this via `@JoinColumn(name="...")` inside `@JoinTable`.

| Join Table
| A bridge table (e.g., `author_book`) holding two FKs:
- `book_id` → books.id
- `author_id` → authors.id

| Owning Side
| The entity that defines `@JoinTable` and and manages the join table. +
Example in Book: +
@ManyToMany +
@JoinTable( name = "author_book", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name="book_id"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn
(name="author_id") ) +
private Set<Author> authors;


| Inverse Side
| The entity that uses `mappedBy` to refer back to the owner—no `@JoinTable` here.
Example in Author: +
@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "authors") +
private Set<Book> books;


| Why `mappedBy`?
| Prevents JPA from creating a second join table.
Ensures only **Book** writes to `author_book`, while **Author** just reads it.


| Simple @ManyToMany
| Direct link between two entities. +
 Join table has only two columns: FK to each side. +
 No extra fields possible.

| Best Practice
| - Keep both collections in sync in your Java code (add/remove on both sides). +
- Use `Set` to avoid duplicates ( Set is a collection for unique elements with unique ID). +
- Only one side owns the mapping. +
- The join table name should reflect the order of columns.


|Why Book is the Owning Side in our example of Many-to-Many

| In JPA, either entity can be the owner of a Many-to-Many relationship.
 Usually, the owner should be the entity that "controls" the relationship in the business logic. +
 In a Book-Author system: +
 We create a Book and assign Authors to it.
 It makes more sense for Book to own the relationship.
 If Author were the owner, we would have to update Authors objects every time we wanted to assign a Book, which feels unnatural (because
 we create a new book, but we persist the author in this case after updating the book set in Author).
|===

*equals() and hashCode() in JPA:* +
- we should override them, especially if you use Sets for relationships. +
- Only use the immutable `id` field for comparisons. +
- Do not include mutable fields like title, name, isbn in equals()/hashCode(). +
- This ensures Sets work correctly and prevents Hibernate synchronization issues. +

=== Example: Tables and Rows for Many-to-Many (Book owns Author)

We insert two Books and two Authors:

Books:
* (id=101) "Java Mastery", isbn "111-AAA"
* (id=102) "Spring Boot Magic", isbn "222-BBB"

Authors:
* (id=1) Alice Smith
* (id=2) Bob Johnson

Relations:
* "Java Mastery" → Alice and Bob
* "Spring Boot Magic" → Alice

Notes:
* Join table name chosen: `book_author` (Book is owner; `book_id` column comes first).
* One row = one link between a Book and an Author.
* A book with N authors → N rows with the same `book_id`.
* An author with M books → M rows with the same `author_id`.
